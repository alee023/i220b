Exercise 3:
x was originally declared as a double, but in main.c, is treated as an int. Doubles are 8 bytes, which are bigger than integers 
(4 bytes). This causes an overflow in memory to y since they are stored consecutively, changing y's value.


Exercise 6:

testvec-static:
main: 0x401bf6 
addvec: 0x401f1f 
multvec: 0x401f8e 

testvec-dynamic:
main: 0x5555555551ee 
addvec: 0x7ffff7fca0f5 
multvec: 0x7ffff7fca164
